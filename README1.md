# Data Modeling

This module covers the fundamental principles of database design and management, emphasizing efficient data storage, retrieval, and optimization. You will learn data modeling techniques using SQL and gain a solid understanding of database normalization, relationships, and constraints. By the end of this module, you will be equipped to architect database structures that effectively address real-world data engineering challenges.

## SQL with SQL Server:

### 1. Fundamentals
- Introduction to SQL
- Basic operations: SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT
- Implementing constraints for data integrity

### 2. Data Definition and Manipulation
- Data Definition Language (DDL) for creating and altering database structures
- Data Manipulation Language (DML) for modifying data within tables

### 3. Advanced Querying Techniques
- Aggregation with GROUP BY
- Set operations: UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT
- Multi-dimensional analysis using CUBE and ROLLUP

### 4. Joining Data
- Understanding and implementing various JOIN types:
  - Inner Join
  - Left (Outer) Join
  - Right (Outer) Join
  - Full (Outer) Join

### 5. Performance and Structure
- Creating and managing INDEXES for query optimization
- Writing and utilizing SUBQUERIES for complex data retrieval
- Designing and implementing VIEWS for simplified data access

### 6. Logical Operations and Automation
- Implementing conditional logic with CASE statements
- Automating database actions using TRIGGERS

### 7. Advanced SQL Concepts
- Structuring complex queries with Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Performing advanced analytics using WINDOW FUNCTIONS

### 8. Encapsulating Logic
- Creating and managing STORED PROCEDURES for reusable database operations
